# First Prints with the Bambu Lab A1 + AMS

I recently picked up the **A1 Lab and AMS** by Bambu Lab, and I have to say—this printer is fantastic. It worked right out of the box. After walking through the quick-start guide, I was ready to go. My first project? Printing some little toy octopuses for my son, Cassius.

What impressed me most was the simplicity. I connected to the printer using the **Bambu Handy** app, tapped a few buttons, and had prints running almost immediately. For the first few jobs, I used the default models and settings right from the app.

## Taking It Further with Bambu Studio

After a few quick wins, I started experimenting with **Bambu Studio**—their full-featured slicer app. It’s a lot more powerful and lets me arrange parts on the print plate much more efficiently. When I learn more about tuning print settings and workflow, I’ll try to write a proper walkthrough or tutorial.

## Why I Bought a 3D Printer

This wasn’t just a toy purchase—I had a very specific goal:  
I wanted to print my own holds for my [DIY climbing wall](https://tblog.tdebian.com/posts/theshed/).

Climbing holds are expensive. A basic pack of 12 costs over $50, and I needed way more than that. A friend printed a sample hold for me, and it held up surprisingly well. That convinced me to try it for myself.

Here are some basic holds I printed right from my phone:

## Troubleshooting Bad Prints

Not everything went smoothly. After a few successful jobs, prints started failing.

Here’s one example of a botched key holder:

It took me a while to figure out the problem, but it turned out to be two things:

1. **Humidity** — my filament was absorbing moisture.
2. **A dirty build plate** — adhesion was inconsistent.

Once I dried out the filament and cleaned the build surface, my prints were back to normal.

## What’s Next

I’m planning to dive into **FreeCAD** to start designing my own climbing holds and parts. I’m also really intrigued by the **Gridfinity** storage system. My goal is to start designing modular storage and wall features—combining Gridfinity with climbing hardware.

Once I get deeper into CAD and slicing workflows, I’ll follow up with another post and some downloadable models.

It’s still early, but this printer has already opened the door to a whole new category of making. More to come soon.
