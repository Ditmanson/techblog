      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;first-prints-with-the-bambu-lab-a1--ams&#34;&gt;First Prints with the Bambu Lab A1 + AMS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently picked up the &lt;strong&gt;A1 Lab and AMS&lt;/strong&gt; by Bambu Lab, and I have to say—this printer is fantastic. It worked right out of the box. After walking through the quick-start guide, I was ready to go. My first project? Printing some little toy octopuses for my son, Cassius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/printer/castle.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;cass’s castle image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What impressed me most was the simplicity. I connected to the printer using the &lt;strong&gt;Bambu Handy&lt;/strong&gt; app, tapped a few buttons, and had prints running almost immediately. For the first few jobs, I used the default models and settings right from the app.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-it-further-with-bambu-studio&#34;&gt;Taking It Further with Bambu Studio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few quick wins, I started experimenting with &lt;strong&gt;Bambu Studio&lt;/strong&gt;—their full-featured slicer app. It’s a lot more powerful and lets me arrange parts on the print plate much more efficiently. When I learn more about tuning print settings and workflow, I’ll try to write a proper walkthrough or tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-i-bought-a-3d-printer&#34;&gt;Why I Bought a 3D Printer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just a toy purchase—I had a very specific goal:&lt;br&gt;
I wanted to print my own holds for my &lt;a href=&#34;https://tblog.tdebian.com/posts/theshed/&#34;&gt;DIY climbing wall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climbing holds are expensive. A basic pack of 12 costs over $50, and I needed way more than that. A friend printed a sample hold for me, and it held up surprisingly well. That convinced me to try it for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some basic holds I printed right from my phone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/printer/cholds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;climbing hold image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-bad-prints&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting Bad Prints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything went smoothly. After a few successful jobs, prints started failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one example of a botched key holder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/printer/khold.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;key holder image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to figure out the problem, but it turned out to be two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humidity&lt;/strong&gt; — my filament was absorbing moisture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A dirty build plate&lt;/strong&gt; — adhesion was inconsistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I dried out the filament and cleaned the build surface, my prints were back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/printer/headphone.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;headphone image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What’s Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m planning to dive into &lt;strong&gt;FreeCAD&lt;/strong&gt; to start designing my own climbing holds and parts. I’m also really intrigued by the &lt;strong&gt;Gridfinity&lt;/strong&gt; storage system. My goal is to start designing modular storage and wall features—combining Gridfinity with climbing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I get deeper into CAD and slicing workflows, I’ll follow up with another post and some downloadable models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s still early, but this printer has already opened the door to a whole new category of making. More to come soon.&lt;/p&gt;
